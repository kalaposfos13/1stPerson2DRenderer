# 1stPerson2DRenderer

This is a school project about rendering a 2D world from the perspective of a 2D entity, who would see the world as a 1D line. The Github artifacts don't work yet, but you can clone the project, build it locally and open it from an IDE. It has an editor and a renderer window.
